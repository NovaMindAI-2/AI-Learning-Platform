Executive Summary: AI-Powered Personalized Learning Platform
Vision
Building an AI-native language learning platform that delivers truly personalized, conversational tutoring at scale—combining the effectiveness of 1-on-1 human instruction with AI's 24/7 availability and affordability. Starting with French language instruction, we're positioned to expand into a comprehensive AI tutoring platform across multiple subjects and languages.
Market Opportunity
The AI education market represents a $5.88 billion opportunity in 2024, projected to reach $32.27 billion by 2030 (31.2% CAGR). We're entering at an inflection point:

Two AI-native startups achieved unicorn status in 2024 (Speak at $1B, Squirrel AI)
92% of university students now use AI learning tools, up from 66% in 2024
Legacy players like Duolingo ($748M revenue) are retrofitting AI into existing platforms, creating opportunities for purpose-built solutions
The market has validated willingness to pay: $4-50/month for AI tutoring vs. $50-100/hour for human tutors

Critical gap identified: While engagement is high, learning outcomes remain disappointing. 74% of tutors and 78% of parents believe AI won't replace human instruction, pointing to the winning model: AI-human augmentation, not replacement.
What We're Building
A voice-enabled AI tutoring platform featuring:
Immediate Differentiation:

Conversational AI tutor with personality customization, not multiple-choice exercises
Personalized curriculum generation based on individual goals, timeline, and learning style
Voice-first interaction for authentic speaking practice
Adaptive learning that builds a personal knowledge graph of what each user has mastered

Technical Foundation:

Claude API for core tutoring intelligence
11 Labs for natural text-to-speech
Web Speech API for voice recognition
Real-time conversation flow with instant feedback

The MVP: Proof of Concept (15-20 Minutes)
User Experience:

2-minute onboarding (goal, level, schedule, tutor personality)
AI tutor introduces itself via voice, asks clarifying questions
Generates personalized curriculum in real-time
Delivers engaging 15-minute first lesson in French
Tracks all progress in personal knowledge base

Success Criteria: User learns to introduce themselves in French and wants to continue to lesson 2.
Target: 70%+ lesson completion, 50%+ return rate, 4+ rating
Strategic Positioning
vs. Duolingo (market leader):

We offer true personalization vs. one-size-fits-all gamification
